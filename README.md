# Pong-for-iPhone
I wrote this mobile recreation of Pong for IOS 11 as a junior in high school. 

The app enjoyed moderate success, reaching the top 34th app in the Sports section and the top 61st in the Arcade section. 

I made some passive income from this for a while. But in college, I stopped paying for an Apple developer account because it turns out college is expense. 

Nevertheless, this app lives on for posterity in Github.

Some of the features of the app include a difficulty setting, high scores, and two player support.
